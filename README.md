## Example

Solve the Maxwell Eigenvalue Problem on a standard Waveguide and print the Electric Fields to a VTK file.

This example encompasses most of the functionality of the library.
```rust
use fem_2d::prelude::*;

fn solve_basic_problem() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Load a standard air-filled waveguide mesh from a JSON file
    let mut mesh = Mesh::from_file("./test_input/test_mesh_a.json")?;

    // Set the polynomial expansion order to 4 in both directions on all Elems
    mesh.set_global_expansion_orders([4, 4])?;

    // Isotropically refine all Elems
    mesh.global_h_refinement(HRef::t());

    // Then anisotropically refine the resultant Elems in the center of the mesh
    let cenral_node_id = mesh.elems[0].nodes[3];
    mesh.h_refine_with_filter(|elem| {
        if elem.nodes.contains(&cenral_node_id) {
            Some(HRef::u())
        } else {
            None
        }
    });

    // Construct a Domain with H(curl) continuity conditions
    let domain = Domain::from_mesh(mesh, ContinuityCondition::HCurl);
    println!("Constructed Domain with {} DoFs", domain.dofs.len());

    // Construct a generalized eigenvalue problem for the Electric Field
    // (in parallel using the Rayon Global ThreadPool)
    let gep =
        galerkin_sample_gep_hcurl::<HierPoly, CurlCurl, L2Inner>(&domain, [Some(8), Some(8)])?;

    // Solve the generalized eigenvalue problem using Nalgebra's Eigen-Decomposition
    // look for an eigenvalue close to 10.0
    let solution = nalgebra_solve_gep(gep, 10.0)?;
    println!("Found Eigenvalue: {:.15}", solution.value);

    // Construct a solution-field-space over the Domain with 64 samples on each "leaf" Elem
    let mut field_space = UniformFieldSpace::new(&domain, [8, 8]);

    // Compute the Electric Field in the X- and Y-directions (using the same ShapeFns as above)
    let e_field_names =
        field_space.xy_fields::<HierPoly>("E", solution.normalized_eigenvector())?;

    // Compute the magnitude of the Electric Field
    field_space.expression_2arg(e_field_names, "E_mag", |ex, ey| {
        (ex.powi(2) + ey.powi(2)).sqrt()
    })?;

    // Print "E_x", "E_y" and "E_mag" to a VTK file
    field_space.print_all_to_vtk("./test_output/electric_field_solution.vtk")?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Mesh Refinement
A `Mesh` structure keeps track of the geometric layout of the finite elements (designated as `Elem`s in the library), as well as the polynomial expansion orders on each element. These can be updated using h- and p-refinements respectively

### *h*-Refinement:
*h*-Refinements* are implemented using the Refinement by Superposition (RBS) method
> Technical details can be found in this paper: [A Refinement-by-Superposition Approach to Fully Anisotropichp-Refinement for Improved Efficiency in CEM](https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/A_Refinement-by-Superposition_Approach_to_Fully_Anisotropic_hp-Refinement_for_Improved_Efficiency_in_CEM/16695163)

Three types of h-refinement are supported:
* **T**: Elements are superimposed with 4 equally sized child elements
* **U**: Elements are superimposed with 2 child elements, such that the resolution is improved in the x-direction
* **V**: Elements are superimposed with 2 child elements, such that the resolution is improved in the y-direction

These are designated as an Enum: `HRef`, located in the `h_refinements` module. They can be executed by constructing a refinement as follows:
```Rust
let h_iso = HRef::T;
let h_aniso_u = HRef::U(None); 
let h_aniso_v = HRef::V(None);
```
...and applying it to an element or group of elements using one of the many *h*-refinement methods on `Mesh`.

Multi-step anisotropic *h*-refinements can be executed by constructing the U or V variant with `Some(0)` or `Some(1)`. This will cause the 0th or 1st resultant child element to be anisotropically refined in the opposite direction.

Mesh coarsening is not currently supported

### *p*-Refinement:
*p*-Refinements allow elements to support a range of expansion orders in the X and Y directions. These can be modified separately for greater control over resource usage and solution accuracy.

As a `Domain` is constructed from a `Mesh`, Basis Functions are constructed based on the elements expansion orders.

Expansion orders can be increased or decreased by constructing a `PRef`, located in the `p_refinements` module:
```Rust
let uv_plus_2 = PRef::from(2, 2);
let u_plus_1_v_minus_3 = PRef::from(1, -3);
```
...and applying it to an element or group of elements using one of the many *p*-refinement methods on `Mesh`.


## JSON Mesh Files

fem_2d uses `.json` files to import and export Mesh layouts. 

* The input format is simplified and describes the geometry of the problem only. 
* The output format describes the Mesh in it's refined state which is usefull for debugging and observing the refinement state.

### Input Mesh Files

A `Mesh` can be constructed from a JSON file with the following format:
```JSON
{
    "Elements": [
        {
            "materials": [eps_rel_re, eps_rel_im, mu_rel_re, mu_rel_im],
            "node_ids": [node_0_id, node_1_id, node_2_id, node_3_id],
        },
        {
            "materials": [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
            "node_ids": [1, 2, 4, 5],
        },
        {
            "materials": [1.2, 0.0, 0.9999, 0.0],
            "node_ids": [2, 3, 5, 6],
        }
    ],
    "Nodes": [
        [x_coordinate, y_coordinate],
        [0.0, 0.0],
        [1.0, 0.0],
        [2.0, 0.0],
        [0.0, 0.5],
        [1.0, 0.5],
        [2.0, 0.5],
    ]
}
```
(The first Element and Node are simply there to explain what variables mean. Those should not be included in an actual mesh file!)

The above file corresponds to this 2 Element mesh (with Node indices labeled):
```text
    3               4               5
0.5 *---------------*---------------*
    |               |               |
    |      air      |    teflon     |
    |               |               |
0.0 *---------------*---------------*
 y  0               1               2
 x 0.0             1.0             2.0

Both Elements start with a polynomial expansion order of 1 upon construction. 

```

This library does not yet support curvilinear elements. When that feature is added, this file format will also be extended to describe higher-order geometry.

### Output Mesh Files

A refined `Mesh` can also be exported and visualized using [this](https://github.com/jeremiah-corrado/fem_2d_mesh_plot) tool:

## Solution Plotting

Solution figures like the ones below can be generated by exporting solutions as `.vtk` files and plotting using a compatible tool (such as [Visit](https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/index.html)):
