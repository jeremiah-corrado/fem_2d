    abstractNote={We present an application of fully anisotropic hp-adaptivity over quadrilateral meshes for H(curl)-conforming discretizations in Computational Electromagnetics (CEM). Traditionally, anisotropic h-adaptivity has been difficult to implement under the constraints of the Continuous Galerkin Formulation; however, Refinement-by-Superposition (RBS) facilitates anisotropic mesh adaptivity with great ease. We present a general discussion of the theoretical considerations involved with implementing fully anisotropic hp-refinement, as well as an in-depth discussion of the practical considerations for 2-D FEM. Moreover, to demonstrate the benefits of both anisotropic h- and p-refinement, we study the 2-D Maxwell eigenvalue problem as a test case. The numerical results indicate that fully anisotropic refinement can provide significant gains in efficiency, even in the presence of singular behavior, substantially reducing the number of degrees of freedom required for the same accuracy with isotropic hp-refinement. This serves to bolster the relevance of RBS and full hp-adaptivity to a wide array of academic and industrial applications in CEM},

    abstractNote={We present an application of refinement-by-superposition (RBS) hp-refinement in computational electromagnetics (CEM), which permits exponential rates of convergence. In contrast to dominant approaches to hp-refinement for continuous Galerkin methods, which rely on constrained-nodes, the multi-level strategy presented drastically reduces the implementation complexity. Through the RBS methodology, enforcement of continuity occurs by construction, enabling arbitrary levels of refinement with ease and without the practical (but not theoretical) limitations of constrained-node refinement. We outline the construction of the RBS hp-method for refinement with H(curl)- and H(div)-conforming finite cells. Numerical simulations for the 2-D finite element method (FEM) solution of the Maxwell eigenvalue problem demonstrate the effectiveness of RBS hp-refinement. An additional goal of this work, we aim to promote the use of mixed-order (low- and high-order) elements in practical CEM applications.},
